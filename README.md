Objective 

Goal: 
Participants will develop the skills needed to secure their Wi-Fi networks, from setting up secure configurations to monitoring for and responding to security threats. 

Skills: 

Configuring secure SSIDs and encryption settings. 

Setting up and managing guest networks. 

Detecting and mitigating unauthorized access. 

Implementing advanced security settings on routers. 

Module Content 

Introduction 

Key Concepts: 
Participants will be introduced to the basics of Wi-Fi security, including key terms such as SSID, WPA3 encryption, and network monitoring. The importance of strong passwords and the risks of default settings will be emphasized. 

Risks: 
The introduction will highlight the main risks associated with insecure Wi-Fi networks, including unauthorized access, data theft, and potential financial and reputational damage to small businesses. 

Core Topics 

Topic 1: Secure Wi-Fi Setup 

Main Points: Participants will learn how to set up a secure Wi-Fi network, including selecting a non-identifiable SSID, enabling WPA3 encryption, and creating strong passwords. 

Guidelines: Clear, step-by-step instructions on configuring these settings will be provided, along with explanations of why each step is important. 

Topic 2: Network Security Monitoring and Threat Response 

Additional Details: This topic covers how to monitor network activity, identify unauthorized devices, and respond to potential security breaches. 

Advice: Practical tips on using network scanning tools, setting up alerts, and maintaining regular firmware updates will be provided. 

Interactive Activities 

Interaction 1: Secure Network Setup 

Activity 1: SSID and Encryption Configuration 
Participants will configure a secure SSID and select the strongest available encryption method (WPA3). Immediate feedback will be provided on their choices, with explanations on the importance of these configurations for modern Wi-Fi security. 

Activity 2: Intrusion Detection and Network Monitoring 
Participants will scan their network for unauthorized devices, learn to recognize signs of intrusion, and respond by implementing real-time monitoring and alerts. This activity simulates the detection and removal of unauthorized devices from the network. 

Interaction 2: Advanced Router Configuration 

Activity 3: Guest Network Setup 
Participants will configure a guest network with limited access, ensuring visitors can connect without compromising the security of the main network. Feedback will be provided on the appropriate settings for guest networks. 

Activity 4: Implementing Advanced Security Settings 
Participants will explore and implement advanced router security features, such as disabling WPS, setting up a firewall, and enabling network isolation. The module will guide them through the process and explain the benefits of each setting. 

Additional Challenges: 
Scenarios will be included that simulate common vulnerabilities, such as weak encryption settings or outdated firmware. Participants will be guided step-by-step to correct these issues, reinforcing the importance of keeping network security up-to-date. 

Learning Outcomes 

Knowledge: 
Participants will understand the core principles of Wi-Fi security, the significance of strong encryption, and the importance of maintaining up-to-date security settings. 

Skills: 
Practical skills include setting up a secure Wi-Fi network, managing access controls, monitoring for unauthorized activity, and implementing advanced router settings. 

Application: 
Participants will be able to apply these skills to their own networks, ensuring their business or home Wi-Fi environments are secure from potential threats. 

Implementation Strategy 

Tools Utilized: 
The module will be developed using Unity, leveraging its capabilities to create a realistic and interactive VR environment. 

Structure of Content: 

Modular Approach: Content is divided into sections, each focusing on a different aspect of Wi-Fi security. 

Progressive Learning: As participants progress through the module, they will encounter increasingly complex scenarios, allowing them to build on their knowledge and skills incrementally. 

Support: 
Participants will have access to a help section for reviewing key concepts and troubleshooting issues. A support community will also be available for questions and peer interaction. 

Conclusion 

Impact: 
By completing this training module, participants will be equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to protect their Wi-Fi networks from unauthorized access and other security threats. This will contribute to the overall security posture of their businesses, reducing the risk of data breaches and associated consequences. 

Next Steps: 
Participants will be encouraged to apply the lessons learned to their real-world networks and explore additional resources and advanced modules for further learning.
