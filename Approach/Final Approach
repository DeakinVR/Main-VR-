Insider Threats  

Learning Objectives 

This module is designed to achieve two main objectives related to insider threats in cybersecurity: 

Objective 1: Educate users on the dangers of intentional insider threats and how to identify them. 

Objective 2: Educate users on the dangers of unintentional insider threats and how negligence and lack of awareness can lead to them. 

Narrative Overview 

This module will contain three scenarios: 

Scenario 1: 
Users will be tasked with observing three different office desks. Two of these desks will have security risks: 

One desk will have sticky notes with passwords and important information. 

Another desk will present an unlocked computer with access to confidential information. 

The third office desk will be completely secure with no security risks. Users must identify the unsafe office desks that could lead to a malicious insider taking advantage of them. 

Scenario 2: 
In this scenario, users must assign access rights to different employees. They need to ensure that each employee only has access to the resources necessary for their job. For example: 

The user will be presented with an intern and must determine their access level. 

The user will be presented with the CEO and must determine their access level. 

If users fail, they will be shown the dangers of an insider threat with unauthorized access. 

Interactive Elements 

Scenario 1: 
Users will actively walk around the office space and observe each office desk. When selecting an answer, users will hover their VR controller over a collection of buttons presented in a 3D UI menu. Information regarding the task will be provided on the same UI menu before they start. 

Scenario 2: 
This scenario will focus more on reading rather than interacting with objects. The user will be presented with an example of a possible employee (e.g., intern, CEO, financial advisor). They must decide the appropriate access rights for the employee by selecting options presented in the UI. 

VR Environment Design 

Scenario 1: 
Set in a small generic office space, this scenario will use all the available space to allow users to observe and identify the actions of various employees. This design is intended to educate small businesses. 

Scenario 2: 
The environment will differ from Scenario 1, with the focus primarily on the computer screen. The surrounding area will have a general office setting but with limited background elements to minimize distractions. 

Feedback and Assessment 

Feedback: 
Users will receive instant feedback on their performance after completing each task. They must correctly complete each scenario before moving on to the next. If they fail, they will be asked to try again until they succeed. 

Assessment: 
The assessment will focus on general information regarding insider threats: 

Scenario 1 will assess users on their ability to identify a malicious employee based on their actions. 

Scenario 2 will assess users on their decision-making process in handling cybersecurity scenarios, such as selecting a password, clicking website links, and answering phishing emails.
